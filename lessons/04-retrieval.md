## Challenge

The focus over the next two sessions will be to build the following app...

### Flask Bitcoin

Build an app that will find the best exchange rates for Bitcoin (USD -> Bitcoin)  from the following cryptocurrency exchanges:

1. [BTC-E](https://btc-e.com/)
1. [YoBit](https://yobit.net/)
1. [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)

It should have the following pages:

1. The first page should display the rates and highlight the best one
1. The second page should display the rates over time

### Instructions

We'll work through the pseudocode together. You'll code the app either alone (or with the awesome, good-looking people at your table). We'll come together after each step to review.
